Emission pre-processor for atmospheric chemistry models
-------------------------------------------------------

This is yet another emission pre-processor for use with atmospheric chemistry
models.  It is being developed for `WRF-Chem
<https://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/wrf-chem/>`__, but there is no reason why it shouldn't
in principle also work for other models.
